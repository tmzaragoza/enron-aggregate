# Aggregation practice

Mess around with aggregations. There's nothing special
about them, there's nothing magic about them. Play
around with the sample enron email data.

There are two aggregates to create as part of this
repo: `lib/emails-per-day.js` and `lib/email-recipients.js`.
Fill in the array with aggregation stages. Once correct,
the tests in `test/aggregate.test.js` should pass.

There are some [hints](hints.md) provided. Be careful
of potential spoilers there. Try to use the hints only
if you get stuck.

If you really get stuck, or just want to check your
answer see the [answers](answers.md).

To check your answers run the provided tests.

## Setup

A read-only db connection to an mlab database is
provided by `test/connect.js`. Tests require an
internet connection.

* `npm i`
* Run tests with `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`

## Example document

```json
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("4f16fca5d1e2d3237100927d"),
    "body" : "Your just a little jokester today - What do you mean \"try and fit me in your schedule\"     I will be there - and you will make the time for me -Because you have NO OTHER CLIENTS!!!!\n\nthanks for the laughs\ni love you",
    "filename" : "23.",
    "headers" : {
        "Content-Transfer-Encoding" : "7bit",
        "Content-Type" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii",
        "Date" : ISODate("2001-04-19T02:40:00.000Z"),
        "From" : "sandra.brawner@enron.com",
        "Message-ID" : "<11280155.1075845089118.JavaMail.evans@thyme>",
        "Mime-Version" : "1.0",
        "Subject" : "Re: Misc",
        "To" : [ 
            "kennethbrawner@email.msn.com"
        ],
        "X-FileName" : "Brawner, Sandra F..pst",
        "X-Folder" : "\\Brawner, Sandra F.\\Brawner, Sandra F.\\Sent Items",
        "X-From" : "Sandra F Brawner",
        "X-Origin" : "BRAWNER-S",
        "X-To" : "kennethbrawner  <kennethbrawner@email.msn.com>",
        "X-bcc" : "",
        "X-cc" : ""
    },
    "mailbox" : "brawner-s",
    "subFolder" : "sent_items"
}
```

## Emails per day

Find the number of emails sent per day.

## Email recipients

Find the number of emails sent to each email address. Sort the result
in order of most received to least received.

## MongoDB syntax

### Stages

* `$unwind`: make a new document for each item in an 
array [Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/)

* `project`: select or manipulate fields in a document
[Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/)

* `group`: group by a field in a document [Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/group/)

* `sort`: sort by a field. [Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/)

### Operators

* `dateToString`: format a date/time into a string. E.G. 
`{ $dateToString: { format: '%Y-%m-%d', date: '$headers.Date' } }`
[Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/dateToString/)

* `sum`: add numbers. [Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/)

* `addToSet`: add item into an array, removing duplicates.
[Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addToSet/)

* `size`: get the size of an array. [Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/size/)

* `min`: get the minimum value seen for a field in a group by.
[Docs]()

* `max`: get the maximum value seen for a field in a group by.
[Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/max/)

* `avg`: get the average value seen for a field in a group by.
[Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/avg/)
